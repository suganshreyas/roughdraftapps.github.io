                <p>Rough Draft Oy, operating under the brand name Rough Draft Apps, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our iOS applications and website.</p>

                <h2>Information Collection</h2>
                <p>Our applications are designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information from users of our applications unless explicitly stated within a specific application.</p>
                
                <h3>Data We Do Not Collect</h3>
                <p>Unless otherwise specified in an individual application, we do not collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal identification information such as name, email address, or phone number</li>
                    <li>Location data</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers</li>
                    <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                    <li>Cookies or tracking technologies on our website</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Data Stored Locally</h3>
                <p>Some of our applications may store data locally on your device to provide functionality. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties. Local data may include application preferences, user-created content, or cached information necessary for the application to function.</p>

                <h2>Use of Information</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not use personal information for any purpose. Any data stored locally on your device is used solely to provide the functionality of the application.</p>

                <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personal information to third parties because we do not collect personal information.</p>
                
                <h3>Apple App Store</h3>
                <p>Our applications are distributed through the Apple App Store. Apple may collect certain information in connection with your download and use of our applications. Please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy for information about their data practices.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>While we do not collect personal data, we implement appropriate technical measures to ensure the security of our applications and any data processed locally on your device.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our applications do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal information from any users, our applications can be used by individuals of all ages.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our applications do not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services unless explicitly disclosed within a specific application.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                <p>Since we do not collect or store personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete. All application data is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by removing the application.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
