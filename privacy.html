    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps builds small, independent iOS apps with a focus on clarity,
        usefulness, and respect for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe privacy is a basic expectation, not a feature. Our apps are designed
        to collect as little data as possible and to operate primarily on the user’s device.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:info@roughdraftapps.com">info@roughdraftapps.com</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps does not require users to create accounts or provide personal
        identifiers such as name, email address, or phone number to use our apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to contact support by email, we receive the information you
        voluntarily include in your message.
      </p>

      <h3>App Usage & Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>
        To understand performance and improve reliability, our apps use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firebase Analytics (anonymous usage metrics)</li>
        <li>Firebase Crashlytics (crash and error reporting)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This data includes technical details such as device type, operating system
        version, app version, and interaction events. It does not directly identify you.
      </p>

      <h3>Subscriptions & Payments</h3>
      <p>
        Paid features are managed through the App Store using RevenueCat.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not receive or store payment card details, billing information, or Apple ID
        credentials. RevenueCat processes anonymous purchase and subscription status
        data solely to manage access to paid features.
      </p>

      <h3>User Identifiers</h3>
      <p>
        Our apps may generate a random, non-personal user identifier visible in app
        settings. This identifier is not linked to your identity and exists only to help
        diagnose issues if you contact support.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p>Information is used only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate core app functionality</li>
        <li>Improve performance and stability</li>
        <li>Understand feature usage at a high level</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests</li>
        <li>Manage subscriptions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell data, rent data, or use data for advertising purposes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Artificial Intelligence Features</h2>
      <p>
        Some Rough Draft Apps include AI-based features to analyze user-provided input
        such as text or images.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI processing is used only to deliver the requested functionality. We do not build
        personal profiles, and we do not associate AI results with user identities.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage & Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps does not operate its own servers or user databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limited data is processed by trusted third-party services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Firebase (analytics and crash reporting)</li>
        <li>RevenueCat (subscription management)</li>
        <li>Apple App Store services</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our apps are not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        You can limit analytics collection through system-level settings where available.
        App data can be removed at any time by deleting the app from your device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        This policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this
        page with an updated revision date.
