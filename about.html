      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps is an independent iOS studio based on a simple idea:
        meaningful software is rarely finished — it’s revised.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name reflects how the work is approached. Start small. Ship early.
        Pay attention. Improve what matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        The studio focuses on utility-driven apps — tools that quietly fit
        into daily life and earn their place through usefulness rather than
        novelty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps is operated as a solo practice, valuing clarity,
        restraint, and long-term care over rapid expansion.
