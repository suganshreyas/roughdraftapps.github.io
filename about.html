      <p>
        Rough Draft Apps is an independent iOS studio based on a simple idea:
        Done is better than perfect. Shipping something simple, and value-additive to users, is more important than chasing perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here to ship tools that quietly fit into daily life of users. Rough Draft Apps is operated as a solo practice, valuing clarity,
        restraint, and long-term care over rapid expansion.
